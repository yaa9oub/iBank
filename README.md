Lino Bank is a native android mobile application.

This app helps its primary users to make reservations in their favorite banks. 
It shows them the closest banks in a Google map, and help them consult how many users are waiting in the line.
And give a waiting estimation using the number of users in the line and the physical distance between the user and the bank.

In this app I worked with QR codes, reading and writing. Another mobile app for the administration of the bank where the admin control the number of clients.
Google map also was a good feature I worked with. Along with firebase authentication, and firebase firestore for saving users data.
